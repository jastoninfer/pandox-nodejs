$$If Wang Yu is so fond of writing this "drama," then it's not really drama but a necessary skill for filler chapters. Having a dozen or so filler chapters is no problem. If it's this much filler, it should have flopped long ago. Battles, magical artifacts, world exploration, and the protagonist's cultivation are what really matter.
>>A novel chapter can easily span thousands of words, while an anime episode is just a short ten minutes. Isn't adopting such a childish approach like stumbling babies? How can this take off?
>>

$$The result of too many literary scenes is that many casual viewers will definitely give up
leaving only the die-hard fans
Nowadays, with so many choices, casual viewers don't have that much patience.
"Fanren" became famous for its unique characteristics; I hope they can still make some choices when it comes to the drama.
>>But there aren't many options on Bilibili, right?
>>

$$If other animations are willing, expanding on such issues is not a problem. For example, the complex character relationships in the entire Duke's Mansion in Huo Yuhao? You can write about such things casually because they are far less difficult than balancing settings and power levels.
>>

$$Directly transplanting the clichéd plots and performances from TV dramas makes the drama in anime look very poor. Moreover, the performances are not as good as those in TV dramas. One of the main reasons I don't like watching TV dramas is because there are too many awkward plot points today. Also, "Fanren" often has too bland drama, which is hard to arouse people's emotions.
>>Fellow Daoist, you're mistaken. I think the direction of drama in "Fanren" is good. I quite enjoyed the drama in the first episode of "Star Sea Speeding." How can there be no joy and sorrow, happiness and anger? These are the most realistic insights, perfectly setting off the hardships of cultivation and reflecting people's inner feelings.
>>Last year, I even said that the drama in "Fanren" is more enjoyable to watch than the fights in "Doupo Cangqiong." I've stopped watching "Doupo Cangqiong" now, and I'm losing interest in "Fanren" after the New Year episodes. Currently, "Bilibili" is updating "Ten Directions Martial Saint," which I find more interesting than "Fanren."
>>

$$Checking the declining membership week broadcast data might give Wang Yuren some feedback.
>>I guess Lao Wang is too busy to care for the time being.
>>Xu Tian Palace is done; I can only wait for next year's new episodes now.
>>

$$Even if there are battles, "Fanren" is quite ordinary. It continues that old-school martial arts fighting plus laser waves. Whether it's rain of fire or ice, I got tired of these martial arts plots back in '08. There's no tension or imagination in the fights. Fighting is 100% misses. Getting hit causes no injury. Chasing scenes display monsters' edgy skills. There's no combat logic or awareness. Either wait until the enemy is half-dead or attack the monster's weak spot. Combat is just defending and plotting against teammates. It's quite frustrating.
>>Your evaluation is really... forget it.
>>What's the point of talking to him? He already said "Xian Ni Episode 18" was excellent, but "Fanren's" fighting isn't up to par. "Xian Ni Episode 18" is excellent.
>>You green guys ✌🏻 are all the same.
>>

$$Actually, "Fanren"'s novel has exciting parts with a cool writing mode, defeating anyone they meet, like Han Li in the late Nascent Soul stage. It also has a mode with lots of literary scenes, like the Xu Tian Dian, which you all highly praise.
The entire plot of the Xu Tian Dian is connected through the Blood Jade Spider, with the complex and changing relationships between the characters, climaxing in the Xu Tian Dian.
The excitement of the Xu Tian Diane comes largely from the conflicts and cooperation between characters like Ji Yin, Xuan Gu, Han Li, Wu Chou, Man Huzi, and Qing Yi. These are all strung together by numerous literary scenes.
Wanting to remove the literary scenes because you think there are too many is unreasonable if you want to see pure cool writing. I think you shouldn't be watching "Fanren".
As for the arrangement of the literary scenes and the length of each week's episode, as well as whether the literary scenes themselves are exciting, that's another matter.
>>So, are the dialogues in the shop in today's episode all necessary? Are they also for threading the plot?
>>Yes, the Transforming "Fanren" chapter is about cultivating the mind in the world and refining one's life treasure in the process. Also, there's foreshadowing in the little dragon's broadcast.
>>It's too long.
>>That's how the novel chapters progress. Since they choose to do a long series, this kind of story thread is indispensable. It's hard for those following weekly, but for those who watch all at once, the experience will be different.
>>So, we're discussing another topic, the excitement of the literary scenes. Based on the comments I saw today, there are complaints about the Great Elder's pompous and roundabout actions.
>>Now, which long series isn't lengthy? The market impact isn't as simple as you think. "Fanren"'s strength lies largely in its uniqueness and the simple competitive model on Bilibili. Look at other platforms, which one doesn't pack each episode with highlights?
>>In the novel, except for Ximen, the other elders of the Star Palace are faceless. From the beginning, the animation wanted to highlight several elders to link the long years of the Star Palace battle. At the same time, through detailed depiction of the beginning and end of the Xu Tian Dian, the animation aims to complete this huge subplot, giving each character a story and reason for appearing, making most of their appearances push the story forward.
>>In the novel, characters like Madam Wen, who go offline immediately after appearing, would be purely side characters in the animation. It's a waste of money to show them. There's no problem writing like this in the novel, as it doesn't cost much to lay the text foundation. TV dramas can also perform this way with numerous extras. In animation, each model is real money, and once it's made, they need to fully explore the character's story appeal.
>>That means there's something wrong with the arrangement.
>>How many episodes did the Hidden Evil Sect take? Then talk about wasting time. The Green Bamboo Pavilion storyline could have three episodes. It's okay, there's still more to waste. Four episodes a month. Saying it wastes time is kind of funny. Besides, why should viewers care about wasting money? Spending time on the script is more important than anything.
>>Right, in the three main subplots, Han Li's fighting scenes are not many. They're mostly laying out the story.
>>Wasting money means that each new character model created by the animation team should have significance in pushing the story forward. Creating different models just to be part of the background is a waste of money and effort in animation.
>>Literary scenes are the foundation of good martial scenes. The best is to intersperse literary scenes within martial scenes. If that's not possible, then the literary scenes should be made exciting, enhancing the story's drive. Reducing literary scenes is the worst direction.
>>Why doesn't it work? Being a background character is its best effect, right? Who wants to see the background character overshadow the main character every day? If you're thinking for the production team, they have more than one way. Writing more about the main character saves more money.
>>It's true that interspersing literary scenes in martial scenes is good, but your latter part is a bit off. If it doesn't work, the proportion of both should be balanced, not strengthening the literary scenes. The literary scenes are already quite ordinary. The director can't strengthen it any further. There's nothing to strengthen.
>>I'm not part of the production team, so I don't consider for them. In my opinion, the literary scenes should enhance the sense of paragraphs and extend the duration. What I'm saying is that for the characters around the main character, the animation team chose not to treat them as background characters, while you think they should be.
>>If you're not in an upgrade flow, you don't have to be a background character. But if it's a fixed upgrade flow mainline, the main character should have a lot of scenes. It's problematic to mess it up like this. Extending the duration isn't an excuse for learning some TV drama scenes.
>>Your efficiency is really poor. If you don't manage a household, you won't know how expensive it is. The money of the gold sponsor also needs a return.
>>In the last year's season, the big explosion episodes like the Mine Cave Battle and the Imperial Palace Battle, characters like Xuan Le, Lü Tianmeng, Liu Jing, and Zhong Wei Niang were pure NPCs in the novel, disappearing after appearing. The animation team carefully depicted their reasons for appearing, their thoughts, and the relationships between the characters. The novel wasn't popular during this period, but the animation was, proving this route has an audience.
>>Animation should have its own way of expression, artistic, romantic, imaginative, rather than always thinking about what to write after abandoning the upgrade. There are already plenty of such things on the market.
>>So, do the viewers still remember?
>>Do they still appear after changing the map? If not, what's the point of creating them?
>>Enhancing the sense of paragraphs means that literary scenes should shape the characters' psychology and personality in short chapters as much as possible. For example, with Green Bamboo Pavilion, it would be great if this episode and the next could form a complete story. In the case of the Five Friends of Hanmen, each episode should take on a different perspective to show the contradiction between the characters and their surroundings, or the encounter and the great crisis they experience together. This way, the story is full of tension and the literary scenes are deep, giving people a sense of satisfaction.
>>Yuren's story structure, even when condensed this much, cannot change the fact that it is a male-oriented resource cultivation story. The entire story structure is not an escape room. It keeps plucking at the same romantic scenes repeatedly. To put it bluntly, even ancient romance dramas change their settings and have adventure segments.
>>Then you should ask those who think those explosion episodes were good if they remember those characters. Without these brilliant characters, how exciting would Han Li's one-man show be?
>>Quite good? What about the declining performance? Capital needs confidence too.
>>So, what use is a complete story?
>>Do today's posts prove these characters are useful?
>>Maybe you should ask how good Han Li's one-man show would be. We can already see it's not that great.
>>There are already enough pure upgrade flow animations, we don't need "Fanren" to be like that. Of course, you want "Fanren" to speed up the pace and reduce the portrayal of surrounding supporting characters, which is also understandable. So, everyone's experience is different.
>>In the last season, the literary scenes during the Capital Battle were much worse, and the performance was not ideal, forcing the production team to release the battle edits early. Excessive literary scenes didn't just appear this season.
>>The opinion on Tieba does not equal the opinion of the audience. The Capital Battle arc was criticized from episode 41 onwards, from literary scenes to martial scenes, everything was criticized heavily.
>>I watched those literary scenes, they weren't this dull.
>>If it's a win-win situation, then it seems you don't need to explain anything.
>>Without this IP, it would have been dead a long time ago. Its survival is due to the IP name, allowing big directors to go all out.
>>If you were following the season on Tieba last year, you'd remember. During the Capital Battle arc, the literary scenes, pacing, and martial scenes were criticized more heatedly than this. Due to the overwhelming audience feedback and impatience, the production team released the climax battle episodes early to appease the viewers.
>>I didn't criticize, and I wasn't there, not everyone has the same opinion. My view on Battle Through the Heavens is also different from Tieba's.
>>Didn't you stop watching anime? Are these things just your imagination?
>>Upstairs, if you think repeating yourself can stop the plot from being discussed, go ahead and repeat.

$$Still calling them casual viewers? Those who can see this are either true fans or drama fans. The so-called casual viewers were filtered out by the first few dozen episodes.
>>That's not right. An anime continuously attracts new viewers and also loses viewers. Attracting newcomers is the skill of the "Fanren" team, and losing viewers is also within their ability. The biggest regret for an ambitious anime is not being able to retain new viewers and only filtering out die-hard fans.
>>So your post is just a review of the latest episode, right? Can new viewers decide to stay or leave based on just one episode? I dare you to watch the last fifteen minutes of "Forrest Gump" and tell me if you can like it? That's hilarious 🤣.
>>How long is one episode of "Forrest Gump"? If you want to compare a movie to an anime, you might as well compare it to "White Snake." Does it lack drama?
>>Nonsense, there are plenty of casual viewers even at 80 episodes. I gave up on "One Piece" after over 400 episodes, and stopped watching "Bleach" after the Aizen arc. Such cases are very common.
>>You're redefining "casual viewer." Watching dozens or even hundreds of episodes still counts as casual.
>>Don't be ridiculous.
>>It's laughable that you don't understand that every episode can bring in new viewers. I started "Cang Yuan Tu" at episode 17, and "Perfect World" at over 100 episodes. 
>>Very normal. I watched hundreds of episodes of "One Piece" and "Conan," but I'm still a casual viewer. Sometimes I just lose interest and never pick it up again. 80 episodes is still a long way to go.
>>They were telling you that some people start at episode 80, not that some have watched over 80 episodes.
>>Oh, I see.
>>Now I understand.
>>

$$Long-running anime have a long-term vision. Maybe there's a lot of drama now, but that's only for this period. It takes up a very small proportion in a series with hundreds of episodes.
>>Which shortsighted person thinks "Cang Yuan Tu" doesn't have a long future? Its pacing is currently the best in domestic anime. Even "Douluo Dalu 2," which is criticized by many, has highlights in every episode. It's just that competition has become fierce.
>>

$$Brother Yongsheng, look at this. Is it a flag?
>>Who's setting a flag? I don't understand.
>>"See you in three weeks"—don't judge based on just one episode.
>>Each episode of an anime should be a labor of love. This is my impression from watching "Cang Yuan Tu." I'm not drawing conclusions, but it's right to make the exciting parts well, and the slow parts should be handled skillfully. "Cang Yuan Tu" arranged a crisis during a peaceful festival, with sudden tension and an unexpected ending. Their effort is commendable and worth learning from. As for "Fanren," I guess Director Wang is too busy.
>>In three weeks it's Chinese New Year. The director will post updates. Qingzhu Xiaoxuan said the whole story will be complete in two to three episodes, about two weeks.
>>"Cang Yuan Tu" handles daily drama well, but in the climax episodes, the drama drags it down. If this were "Fanren," the audience would create such a big fuss that the production team would have to redo it.
>>

$$My view is that if the drama is done well, it doesn't matter if there's a lot. In this episode, the director wanted too much. It's best to evaluate after the whole story is told. Casual viewers come in many forms, and there are those who enjoy this style too.
>>It's normal for audiences to have diverse tastes. Relying only on a niche audience without appealing to the broader base isn't suitable, right?
>>Honestly, I don't know which group constitutes the broader base. If it's really the drama-heavy episodes that cause people to leave, then as a long-running anime, it's acceptable to lose those viewers. The key issue is whether the drama is engaging enough.
>>

$$Stick to your style; it doesn't matter if casual viewers watch or not. As long as the original fans like it, it's okay.
>>Only pleasing the original fans won't sustain the "Fanren" team financially...
>>

$$Too much drama and no fight scenes don't sit well with most people. Recently, "Fanren" and "Tuntun" are like this; no exceptions. Most people watch anime for the special effects.
>>Maybe that's why I still don't watch "Avengers"... I prefer drama. I like fight scenes too, but I don't have much interest in rewatching them. On the other hand, I'm more interested in drama.
>>Not everyone watches just for the special effects. The plot doesn't need to be too deep, but it must resonate and touch the audience. If it were just about piling on special effects, it would flop quickly. "The Great Ruler" already demonstrated this.
>>

$$There's a bit too much drama in the New Year episodes. Whether it's drama or action, too much of either isn't good for the experience.
Qingzhu Xiaoxuan has been on Director Wang's mind for a long time. This episode sets the stage; let's see the next two episodes for the payoff.
>>The animation hasn't collapsed; it's just that Qingzhu Xiaoxuan's part was a bit dull. Compared to the first episode of "Star Sea Speeding," the difference is significant. I know it's unrealistic to expect each episode to be at that level, but if you can't do it well, it's better to trim the low-quality drama. That's proper pacing.
>>

$$Adding more scenes isn't an issue. The Six Sects of the Southern Region have fled to the Nine Nations Alliance and are fighting there. You could show two scenes of that.
>>It would be too monotonous if it's not varied. This is a good suggestion.
>>

$$Actually, this episode explained a lot of information. Not everyone has read the original novel.
>>Boring parts drive away viewers even more, which is a bigger issue than not having read the original.
>>

$$It's quite good. Right now, it feels slow, but when binge-watching, such episodes provide a relaxing break.
>>Lao Wang: I also think it's quite good, but the market feedback isn't great.
>>

$$Let's take it easy for a bit.
>>

$$When the Xu Tian Palace has continuous fight scenes for more than ten episodes, people will complain it's too much.
>>

$$I think it's just you overthinking it. I really enjoy the drama in "Fanren."
>>

$$Episodes 26-34 of "Modao Zhenfeng" were all drama, and it worked out fine.
>>

$$As long as it's not brainwashed fans, everyone can see the pacing issues. Only die-hard fans can self-rationalize it.
>>
